This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme.
You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages].
The [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally.
This lets you test changes before committing them, as well as avoiding delays due to GitHub Pages.
And you can deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site uses:

- a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to publish the site on GitHub Pages each time it changes

You can easily change which versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll to load, as well as adding further plugins.

***Before publishing the created site, you need to update its `_config.yml` as explained in the [README] file!***

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use the theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click ["use this template"]!
